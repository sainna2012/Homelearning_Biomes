         <p>Due to irregular logging, soy farming, and cattle ranching, the Brazilian Amazon has lost more than 18% of its rainforest in the last 40 years, or an area roughly the size of California. The majority of the surviving forest is in danger, despite the establishment of protected zones in recent decades. The only thing Brazil has done to protect is signing an agreement to stop deforestation by 2030 at the UN climate summit in 2021. This goal has potential since, unlike previous ones, the private industry has made a $7.2 billion commitment to decrease the negative effects of farming on the forest with 141 nations.</p>

         <p>Just like Peru, Ecuador is also having trouble with deforestation with palm oil, cattle, soy, pulp and paper industries. To prevent that, Ecuador's national government created the Socio Bosque programme, a protection effort that pays private forest farmers for protecting their forests.
