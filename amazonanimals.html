         <p>Blue Morpho Butterfly, also called the Peleides Blue Morpho, stand out in the treetops thanks to their unique bright blue colour and polished, light-reflecting wings. They are one of the biggest butterflies in the world, with size varying up to 20 cm and lengths of about six inches. A tropical climate is necessary for the Blue Morpho butterfly. Adult blue morphos are believed to be unexpected and strong flyers, making them challenging for predators to catch. Unlike some butterflies, they don't drink flower nectar; instead, they eat rotten fruit, aged tree sap, fungus, and even dead animals. The blue morpho can quickly locate food in its home of a tropical jungle thanks to this variety in its feeding behaviour.</p>

         <p>Capybara are massively larger than their guinea pig siblings and can grow to be over 100 lbs (45 kg) in weight and 4 feet (1.2 m) long and 2 feet (0.6 m) tall. They have a thick, barrel-shaped body that is supported by fairly short front and back legs. Capybaras can move over water or swampy terrain more quickly thanks to their semi webbed feet. The capybara's eyes, nose, and ears are situated on top of its head, similar to a hippopotamus, allowing it to rise just above water for a breath of air and a simple search for predators while the majority of its body remains unseen. These are herbivores that consume other freshwater plants as well as the vegetation that covers water sources. Additionally, they consume their own waste, which contains helpful organisms that help the digestion of grass fibre in their stomachs. Jaguars, caimans, and anacondas are naturally dangerous to capybaras, while ocelots and harpy eagles may steal their young. Humans are the greatest threat to them, as they are heavily targeted for both their meat and their skin, which may be used to make leather.

         <p>The tan-coloured cougar, commonly known as the mountain lion or the puma, has a white or cream-coloured chin, and underbelly. The ears are arched and have a strong black-to-dark-grey colour on the back. The tail is thick, lengthy (up to half the length of the body), and black-tipped. They are the fourth-largest cat species, with males typically being about 2.5 m long and 62 kg in weight (155 pounds). They also produce sounds that are more like those of little cats than the roars of huge cats. Cougars are strong at climbing trees, which helps them avoid larger predators like bears and jaguars who occasionally live in their habitat. Cougars are carnivores that frequently chase animals with hooves, including deer, elk, cows, and sheep. They have a habit for hunting birds and other smaller animals.</p>

         <p>The habitat for these creatures are rivers. Males typically measure from five and six feet long and weigh approximately 55 and 70 pounds, while females are just slightly shorter and lighter. On the throat and chin of their dark brown coats are many white or yellow markings. Every otter has a different pattern on these patches that are unique to them. Giant otters eat a variety of sea creatures like prawns, frogs, small caimans, or snakes. They mainly consume fish. These enormous weasels swim by using their strong tails and lengthy bodies to force themselves forward. Additionally, they have webbed feet, water-repellent fur that keeps them dry and warm and water-sealing noses and ears.</p>

         <p>Tapirs generally feature oval, light-skinned ears, curved, flaring rumps with short tails, and wide-hooved toes with four toes on the front feet and three on the back feet to help in walking on a muddy and soft surface. Tapirs come in a variety of sizes, although most measure around 2 metres long, stands about 1 metre (3 feet) tall, and weigh between 150 and 300 kilograms (330 and 700 lb). All tapir species have spotted and striped coats on their young to help them blend in. Grass, seeds, fruits, berries, and other types of greenery are eaten by tapirs. They are classified as herbivores because they do not consume meat. The defining feature of a tapir is its unusual claw snout. They may hunt by using their snout to collect leaves in addition to twisting it. They can utilize it as a snorkel when swimming! They are skilled and quick swimmers.
