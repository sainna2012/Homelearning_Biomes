         <p>In Arizona, the drop in greenhouse gas emissions and the development of resilience are the two main objectives the city wants to accomplish by 2050. The Environmental Protection Agency's definition of stable energy, which includes fossil fuels like gas and oil, transportation, and waste as a resource is the focus of emission reduction goals. For environmental reasons, they are also attempting to use less plastic.

         <p>The California Deforestation-Free Procurement Act, AB 416, has been proposed by the state. California will be the first state in the nation to save global forests by linking the creation of specific items to moral criteria that reduce deforestation if the bill is passed into law. Another act by California is, the Native Plants Act also protects the vegetation of the Sonoran Desert. Moving native plants from the desert, especially their flowers, fruits, and seeds, is typically against the law. Even taking dying cactus skeletons from the desert is banned.
