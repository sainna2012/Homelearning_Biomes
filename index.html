In the late spring, this plant produces beautiful white flowers, along with red fruit in the summer. Scientists identified and estimated that these cacti can live up to 150-200 years.
       For Saguaros to grow in good conditions, they must not have high elevation otherwise the plant would freeze to death.
       The main factors for this plant are water and temperature.
       A fun fact about the Saguaro Cactus is that they are the largest cactus in the United States.</p>
